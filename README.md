Surrey Surfers

Welcome to the Surrey Surfers repository! This project is a discord bot which offers a fun way to share and communicate with your buddies in Surrey!!

Team Agreements


We have decided to meet twice every week apart from scrum meeting, communicate effectively on the discord server. Incorporate unit testing and then use integrating testing for combining individual effort. Add creative stuff to it.
